# Spotter

Spotter is a robotic system to spot users when they are performing typical barbell lifts (bench, squat, etc.). 

There are multiple features being developed to progress toward Spotter such as  
- measuring bar angle
- tracking bar 3-D position
- measuring bar speed

The challenge was to make a the sensing system using only cameras. 

Tech used: Python, OpenCV, C++ (Arduino)
